/**
 * This function assumes that the metadata branch is checked out already.
 * It is fair since any function that would want to push the metadata branch
 * would have committed on it.
 * ":<n>:<path>, e.g. :0:README, :README
 * A colon, optionally followed by a stage number (0 to 3) and a colon,
 * followed by a path, names a blob object in the index at the given path.
 * A missing stage number (and the colon that follows it) names a stage 0
 * entry. During a merge, stage 1 is the common ancestor, stage 2 is the
 * target branchâ€™s version (typically the current branch), and stage 3 is
 * the version from the branch which is being merged."
 * To rephrase, if stage :0: is empty then a merge is happening. From there
 * on stage 1-3 have the three way merge states. In fact, there cannot be
 * more than those stages even if an octopus merge is performed. The reason
 * is that octopus merges cannot handle conflicts in the same file in multiple
 * branches.
 * @param repo The repo where we will try to push the metadata
